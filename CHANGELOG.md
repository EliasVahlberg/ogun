# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `Node.radius: u32` replaced with `Node.width: u32` and
  `Node.height: u32` for rectangular footprints. Overlap detection is now
  axis-aligned rectangle intersection; repulsion remains centroid-to-centroid.
  Migration: `radius: r` → `width: 2*r+1, height: 2*r+1` for equivalent
  square footprints.

### Added

- `Node.fixed: Option<Pos>` — pre-placed nodes skip EVAL/CHOOSE and are
  committed before the sequential placement loop. Edges between fixed nodes
  are routed during pre-commit. In game-theoretic terms, a fixed node is a
  degenerate agent whose strategy is deterministic (β → ∞, single candidate).
- Expanded `Space::routing_costs` documentation: `None` = 1.0, `0.0` = free,
  `1.0` = normal, `>1.0` = expensive, very high values effectively block
  routing.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- `PotentialKernel` — configurable potential terms on `OgunConfig`:
  - `boundary_affinity: HashMap<NodeId, f32>` — per-node preference for grid
    boundary proximity (positive = prefer edges, negative = prefer center)
  - `cell_bonus: Option<Grid<f32>>` — per-cell bonus/penalty added to utility
    score for terrain compatibility, zoning, or preferred placement zones
- Weighted routing costs — `routing_costs: Option<Grid<f32>>` on `Space`.
  Multiplies base cost before congestion: `routing_cost × (1 + history) × (1 + sharing)`
- `Layout::is_complete()` — convenience method returning true if all nodes placed
- `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives on `Grid<T>`

### Changed

- `Space` gains `routing_costs` field (default `None` = uniform cost 1.0)
- `OgunConfig` gains `kernel` field (default = no extra terms)
- `utility()` accepts `node_id` and `kernel` parameters (internal)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- PathFinder negotiation routing — congestion-aware Dijkstra (Phase 1) with
  rip-up-and-reroute (Phase 2), replacing uniform-cost Lee BFS
- `ScoreBreakdown` — per-metric scores (path efficiency, accessibility,
  congestion, void ratio) instead of a single composite float
- Per-pair repulsion config — `repulsion_pairs: HashMap<(NodeId, NodeId), f32>`
  on `OgunConfig` for category-specific repulsion multipliers
- Per-node metrics on `Layout`: `node_accessibility` (fraction of edges routed)
  and `node_congestion` (average route cost)
- Routing metadata on `Layout`: `route_costs` (per-edge) and `congestion_grid`
  (per-cell overlap count)
- `unplaced: Vec<NodeId>` on `Layout` — reports nodes that couldn't be placed
- `negotiation_iterations` and `history_increment` on `OgunConfig`

### Changed

- `Layout.score` is now `ScoreBreakdown` (was `f32`). Use `.score.composite`
  for the previous behavior.
- Routing uses Dijkstra with congestion costs instead of uniform BFS. Routes
  compete for space, producing emergent road hierarchy.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-14

Initial release.

### Added

- `generate()` — sequential logit dynamics placement with Boltzmann sampling
- Potential function: overlap penalty, inverse-square repulsion, edge attraction
- Lee algorithm (BFS) maze routing for edge paths
- Composite layout scoring (path efficiency, accessibility, congestion, void ratio)
- Configurable inverse temperature β for optimization level control
- Deterministic output via seeded ChaCha8 RNG
- Obstacle and keep-out zone support
- Rayon parallel utility evaluation (adaptive threshold)
- Serde serialization for all public types
